- **Discuss the variables in this dataset, including names / values of
  important variables**

  There are total 15 variables.

  1.  origin: it shows the weather station. (values only contain EWR)
  2.  year, month, day, hour: time of recording. (values from 2013.01.01
      0 hour t0 2013.01.15 23 hour)
  3.  temp, dewp: temperature and dewpoint in F. (values varies)
  4.  humid: relative humidity. (values varies)
  5.  wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust: wind direction in degrees, wind
      speed in mph, and gust speed in mph (some missing values in
      wind_gust). (values varies)
  6.  precip: precipitation in inches. (values varies)
  7.  pressure: Sea level pressure in millibars. (values varies, some
      missing values)
  8.  visib: visibility in miles. (values varies)
  9.  time_hour: date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date.

- **The patterns that are apparent in this plot**

  The trend of temperature and humidity changes in every day is roughly
  the same, during the day the temperature is high and the humidity is
  high, and in the evening and night the temperature is low and the
  humidity is low.

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_data, Factors)): argument is not numeric or

    ## [1] NA

Above all, we could observe that we could calculate the means for the
random samples and the logical vector, but we could not calculate the
means for character vector and factor vector.

``` r
# convert logical, character, and factor variables to numeric

num_logic = as.numeric(p2_data$IsGT0)
```

``` r
num_char = as.numeric(p2_data$Chars)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_factor = as.numeric(p2_data$Factors)
```

Above all, we could observe that we could apply `as.numeric` function to
logical values and factor vectors, but could not apply to character
vectors.

The reasons are as below:

1.  **Logical Variable**: Applying **`as.numeric()`** to a logical
    variable will convert **`TRUE`** to 1 and **`FALSE`** to 0, since
    it’s a binary coding of logical values.

2.  **Character Variable:** There will be two situation when applying
    **`as.numeric()`** to a character variable. If character variables
    are valid numeric representations (e.g., “1”, “2”, “3”), they could
    be converted to numeric. If the character values are not numeric
    representations (e.g., “A”, “B”, “C”), they will be converted to
    **`NA`** (missing values). In our example, since the character
    values are “A”, “B”, …, “J”, they could NOT be converted to numeric.

3.  **Factor Variable**: There will be two situation when applying
    **`as.numeric()`** to a factor vector. If the factors are ordinal,
    they could be convert to numeric vectors where each level is
    replaced with its corresponding integer code. If the factors are
    nominal, it may not be meaningful (but it can also convert to
    numeric). In this example, since “poor”, “normal”, “good” has
    natural order, it’s meaningful with the numeric conversion.

Since R could only calculate the means of numeric values. Except logical
variable would automatically convert to numeric, factor vector and char
vector could not be calculated a mean. Apply `as.numeric` function helps
to calculate the mean values for different variable. But as mentioned
above, some conversion is impossible and some conversion is meaningless,
we should take these into consideration when we do the conversion.
